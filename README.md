# CNN-for-CIFAR10
Project for Udacity Deep Learning with Pytorch course.

Used a CNN with augmented data to train and test the model. CNN architure based off of https://github.com/jamespengcheng/PyTorch-CNN-on-CIFAR10/blob/master/ConvNetClassifier.py with 4 convolutional layers followed by a max pooling layer then 3 fully connected layers.
